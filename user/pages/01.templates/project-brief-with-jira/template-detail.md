The Project Brief is designed to include an entire Product Story in a single doc - from brainstorming, to task tracking, to having a retrospective. This doc grows as the project does, with users adding their own sections, views, and content as they see fit. This is the template we use at Coda to begin our projects, with some added content to show an example of what it could look like filled in.

Many of our customers run engineering execution on Atlassian’s Jira product. We’ve extended our basic template to show how you can set up a Zapier integration to bring data from Jira into Coda.
