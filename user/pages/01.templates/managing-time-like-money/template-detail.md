Get more out of your week by running it with a time budget

## Hi, I’m Matt! I take “Time is money” literally.

Compared to money management, time management is relatively underserved ー there just aren’t enough great tools for it and the best practices are hard to quantify. Go ask someone how they spend their week and you’ll get some hand waving, loose guesses, and lots of uncertainty. Now ask them what they spend on rent or a mortgage every month and you’ll get a crisp number along with a rich set of guidelines for how much that should be based on your financial situation. How should a product manager budget their time? How should a sales leader be spending theirs?

This doc enables you to set budgets for your time ー aka a time budget ー the way you might for money and uses your Google Calendar as the way you keep track.
