Stay on top of your daily to-dos

## 👋 Hi I’m Ellen! This is my to-do system.

Hi! I’m Ellen and I like making new things. I’m working on Dark, with the goal of empowering the next billion developers. We’re starting by making it easy to build backend web services. You could say it’s deployless! More.

Before this, I worked on Lola, Kickstarter, and Office Mobile. I advise and invest with Flybridge and parcelb.vc. I write, speak, and read lots of books. You can find me on Twitter and Instagram or email me.

I already had a to-do system built in Coda, but with the addition of the Gmail Packs table, I’m able to add to-dos to my list based on e-mails I’ve labeled “todo” in Gmail.
