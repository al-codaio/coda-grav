The new Coda Packs, now with data sync. Try now ›

We know your universe of information isn’t just in Coda. It’s all over the placeーin Google Calendars, Jira queues, Figma comments, Slack channels, etc. If you’re like us, you spend your days in a never-ending, constantly fluctuating swirl of data, divided across apps, and trapped inside layouts and UIs you can’t control. If you want to get a handle on what’s going on, you have to keep all your different tools open and cross-reference them manually. E.g. How many hours do you have to actually do work this week? Gotta squint at the calendar grid and count the negative space. And better scan your email inboxes and Slack channels while you’re at it.

Last year, we offered a solution: A new building block called Packs. Packs connect your existing building blocks in Coda to the other apps you use to create and communicate. Since then, we’ve seen your Coda docs go from merely organizing information to actually taking action on it. Now docs can send an email or a text. Or trawl the bottomless depths of Wikipedia and YouTube.

Today, we’re excited to take Packs to the next levelーwith a special new building block we call Packs Tables that pulls in your information and automatically keeps it up to date. We think it’s going to meaningfully change how you interact with your data, and hopefully bring a little more sanityーand a little less copy/pastingーto your day to day.
