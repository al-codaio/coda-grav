I take “Time is money” literally.

Stop lying to yourself. You’re not too busy, you’re just in “time debt” ー and there’s a way out.

I’ve spent most of my career thinking about resource management. I started off in finance thinking about money management ー budgets, forecasts, and spending analyses. And as my career shifted into product management, the focus became time rather than money. But, compared to money management, time management is relatively underserved ー there just aren’t enough great tools for it and the best practices are hard to quantify.

Go ask someone how they spend their week and you’ll get some hand waving, loose guesses, and lots of uncertainty. Now ask them what they spend on rent or a mortgage every month and you’ll get a crisp number along with a rich set of guidelines for how much that should be based on your financial situation. How should a product manager budget their time? How should a sales leader be spending theirs?

I believe that the primary reason for that disconnect is because very few people have a detailed picture of how their time is actually spent ー and thus there’s a general lack of planning and conversation around it. Over the years I’ve tried all sorts of solutions ー from the tedious “time tracking” apps to completely analog tools like the Self Journal. And while all of them felt like steps forward, none of them really stuck. Unlike the financial world which had the spreadsheet ー the Swiss army knife of financial matters ー time management just didn’t have a tool that grew with my needs.

That all changed a few months ago. I finally settled into a solution that was both (1) completely natural to how I currently schedule my time (with Google Calendar) and (2) allowed me to manage resources (i.e. my time) the way that the finance professional in me always wanted to.

Want to skip the story and go straight to the resulting Coda template? You can do so here.

###The inspiration###

A few months ago we started testing a new feature at Coda ーthe recently released Packs Tables. With it, you’re able to import a set of external data ー like issues from Jira, pull requests from GitHub, or events from Google Calendar ー into a tidy, self-synced table in your Coda doc.

Truth be told, over the years we’ve experimented with a few different versions of “external data” in a Coda doc, but none of them seemed to make it meaningfully past a hackathon week. This was also the first time we built a connector explicitly for Google Calendar, so an entirely new realm of possibility suddenly became available with this launch.

So, I added the new Google Calendar Packs Table to my go-to Coda doc (at the time my doc was a glorified to-do list) and overnight the way I manage my week completely changed. My weeks went from being almost entirely reactive in how I spend my time ー trying to just burn down my todo list around meetings ー to feeling proactive; where I allocate my time at the beginning of the week towards the initiatives, projects, or causes that are most meaningful to me. Subsequently it’s let me focus every day on the task at hand each day without feeling the the guilt or pull of not spending time doing something else. Or in finance terms, I’m budgeting for and funding investments in my efforts intentionally ー I’m in control of my cash flow.

To describe a bit of what I mean, it’s easiest to walk through the setup.

###1. Connect to the Google Calendar Pack###
First thing’s first ー you’ll need a doc and you’ll need real data. Almost everyone who works at Coda uses, or has used, the Google Calendar Pack. Just add it, authorize, and Coda will pull all your calendar events into a table. From there you can group, annotate, analyze, etc. I actually sync two calendars: my work calendar and my personal calendar.

###2. Define the Categories to Budget Around###
Next up is to define what’s important to you. Believe it or not, there are 168 hours in the week ー and over 100 that you can meaningfully make use of (sans sleeping). Add a table, look deep within yourself, and start listing out the things you care about. I like to segment by my personal and professional life ー but do what works for you. It’s important to pick meaningful buckets with enough specificity to see trends, but not so many that it’s overwhelming to classify events. I’d suggest no fewer than 5 buckets and no more than 15.

###3. Classify Your Events###
Go to your Packs Table, add a lookup column, and start classifying each calendar event with the categories you just created. This can take a minute depending on how many events are in your calendar, but you can do this faster by sorting by the event title and copy/pasting.

Consider yourself warned ー if you’ve made it this far, you’ve made it to the point where you can check your reality; see just how close your intentions/ambitions match up with where you really spend your time.

###4. Plan your week with intention###
With this setup, you now have a system where every week, you can start with your overall goals, allocate your time accordingly, and focus each day on the task at hand. Your calendar events table will stay up to date on its own (thank you pack tables) and you can course correct when you see trends you need to correct. Unlike money, time is a meaningfully different resource in that you can’t get more of it, you can’t stop spending it, and long term you don’t know how much you actually have.
Personally, setting up the week this way has helped me cope a bit with dad-guilt ー the feeling that I wasn’t spending enough time with my kids or family. In the past, it was easy to get caught in a moment at work when things are really busy and I’d question if I’m spending enough time at home. Now, I have a very tangible measure for when I’m under budget and need to pull back vs when it’s okay to stay focused.
Copy the template here and let me know how it goes. And if you’ve read this far, you’re most likely a productivity nerd like me, in which case, we’re hiring.
