We’ve seen people make Coda docs to run all sorts of unique businesses—from selling baby clothes to baking granola to composting soil.

As different as the docs are, they all tend to follow the same organizational patterns. That’s because taking care of business, whether it’s inventory tracking or customer relationship building, really comes down to a few universal principles: like keeping everything in one place, being consistent in your sorting, and sharing broadly.

A couple weeks ago, we took all those business principles, distilled them into concise templates, then made them available right inside your doc.

I’m here to run you through my personal favorites—the CRM, Check Out system, Gantt Chart, and Photo Table templates—and hopefully show you how they can make your employees happier, your teams more productive, and your business more efficient.

###The CRM###
Any growing business has an expanding list of contacts associated with various projects, whether they’re sales prospects, internal job candidates, or suppliers. On top of that, there are multiple interactions that need to be tracked for every one of those contacts.

You might think you need an expensive customer relationship management solution to handle all of this, but your Coda doc can do it easily. Drag and drop our pre-built CRM into your doc and you can track companies, contacts at those companies, and interactions with those contacts — all in the same place.

Heads up: The ‘Companies’ table is a great example of our table layouts in action. If you want to reconfigure the layout, click the pencil icon in the top right corner of the table to customize the fields however you’d like.
