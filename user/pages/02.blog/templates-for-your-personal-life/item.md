We spend a lot of time discussing how people use Coda at work. But us productivity nerds are still productivity nerds when we’re off the clock. The same methods that keep us sane and organized at work can be used in other areas of our lives.

So today, we’re showcasing templates to help you organize your off-hours — all those weekend trips, group dinners, bachelor and bachelorette parties, Netflix marathons, and the like. Spare your friends the long messy email chains and massive group texts. Impress them with a custom doc instead.

These templates can help get you started:
1. **Personal to-do list:** To-do lists are the first lesson in Productivity 101
2. **Exercise tracker:** There’s no time like the present to set goals. I use the exercise tracker to monitor my progress
3. **Daily journal:** Keeping a journal is a proven practice for mindfulness and general wellbeing. (I’m using this one right now.)
4. **Ratings log:** Great for that friend who is constantly bragging about their vinyl collection 😄

##🗒 Personal To-Do List##
Keeping a list of tasks and tracking the status of each item is the first step for any productivity routine. A crowd favorite, our To-do List in-doc template is the easiest way for you to get startedーsimply drag and drop the template into your doc. You can sort tasks by due date or priority, and when you check them as “done,” conditional formatting gives you a satisfying strikethrough. 

You can also use this template as a starting point to customize as you see fit. I built my personal to-do list with this template and added additional columns to categorize each task by project.
Heads up: This template is a great example of Coda’s conditional formatting at work.
